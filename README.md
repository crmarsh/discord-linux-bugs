# discord-linux-bugs
[Here's a guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000465492) on where to go to report bugs. This project used to be for tracking bugs in Discord's Linux canary builds, but is no longer active. There is also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/discord-testers) for people who want to be involved with reporting bugs.
