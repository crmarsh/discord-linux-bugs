# discord-linux-bugs (abandoned)
This is the old project to track some of the bugs in Discord's linux canary build, however this is abandoned now and shouldn't be used to report bugs anymore. Use the offical [Discord Testers server](https://discord.gg/discord-testers) for this purpose instead.

[The regular download page](https://discordapp.com/downloads) has links to stable and public test build branches. These are what you should be using unless you really like testing out new stuff and don't mind dealing with in-development software. Any help with bug reporting is certainly appreciated, but you shouldn't feel like it is required :-)
